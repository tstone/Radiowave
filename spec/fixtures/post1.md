This is the primary body of my post...

    import math
    class Class:
        """ docstring about this Class """
        def __init__(self, arg):
            self.f = arg + math.cos(arg + arg)
            s = 'Hello World!' # one line comment
            url = escape("highlighted text")

    @property
    def id(self):
        return random()

This is an example of `inline code`.

This is an example of...

```
Tripple blocked
line 2
```

And then some?

The following 3 code blocks have their language manually specified.

    Lang: bsh
    $ cat ~/.bashrc | xclip

Here's what inline `lang: xml <xml>` looks like.

```
LANG: js
function andJavascript() { }
```

The end.
